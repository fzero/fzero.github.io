# Who are you?

I'm Fabio! How's it going? Good? I hope so!

I started working with web development/design/whatever back in 1997, pretty much since this whole thing existed. I was already a programmer back then and was studing Communications at [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro](https://ufrj.br/en/).

Right place, right time, long story short: it's what I do. I work mainly with Ruby and Javascript these days, but I love learning as many programming languages and technologies as I can. Variety is the spice of life and the spice must flow.

## So what's this about?

Web 1.0 was the best web. Personal websites, blogs, webrings - you just had to be there.

The good news is _you are there!_ Everything that worked back then still works right now and you're looking at it with your own eyes.

The web is decentralized, always was and always will be. Anyone can have a website. Don't believe what web3 con artists say.
